# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The project contains one R script called `run_analysis.R` that perform the analysis.

## Prerequist
1. Two libraries are used in this script : `dplyr` and `reshape2`. Please make sure that they are correctly installed.
2. The Samsung data is present in your working directory.

## Run the script
To run the script, one may use the following commands. 
```
source("run_analysis.R")
run_analysis()
```

## Result
The script will create a tidy data set `tidy_data.txt` in the working directory.
